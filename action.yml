      The Go import path of the tested repository to add as a prefix to all paths of the
      changed files. This is useful to map the changed files (e.g., ["foo/my_file.go"]
      to their coverage profile which uses the full package name to identify the files
      (e.g., "github.com/fgrosse/example/foo/my_file.go"). Note that currently, 
      packages with a different name than their directory are not supported.
