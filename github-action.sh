USAGE="$0: Execute go-coverage-report as GitHub action.

This script is meant to be used as a GitHub action and makes use of Workflow commands as
described in https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions

Usage:
    $0 github_repository github_pull_request_number github_run_id

Example:
    $0 fgrosse/prioqueue 12 8221109494

You can largely rely on the default environment variables set by GitHub Actions. The script should be invoked like
this in the workflow file:

    -name: Code coverage report
     run: github-action.sh \${{ github.repository }} \${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} \${{ github.run_id }}
     env: …

You can use the following environment variables to configure the script:
- GITHUB_WORKFLOW: The name of the Workflow (default: CI)
- GITHUB_BASE_REF: The base branch to compare the coverage results against (default: main)
- COVERAGE_ARTIFACT_NAME: The name of the artifact containing the code coverage results (default: code-coverage)
- COVERAGE_FILE_NAME: The name of the file containing the code coverage results (default: coverage.txt)
- CHANGED_FILES_PATH: The path to the file containing the list of changed files (default: .github/outputs/all_changed_files.json)
- REPOSITORY_IMPORT_PATH: The import path of the tested repository to add as a prefix to all paths of the changed files (optional)
- COVERAGE_REPORT_TRIM: Trim a prefix in the \"Impacted Packages\" column of the markdown report (optional)
